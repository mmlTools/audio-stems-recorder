# Audio Stems Recorder for OBS Studio

**Record every sound in your stream as its own professional audio layer.**

Audio Stems Recorder is an OBS Studio plugin that automatically captures each selected audio source into a separate, high‑quality WAV file whenever you start or stop **Recording** or **Streaming**. Instead of a single mixed track, you get clean, perfectly synced stems—ready for professional editing, shorts, highlights, podcasts, and post‑production.

## What You Can Do With It

### 🎙️ Isolated Audio Layers
Record each source independently:
- Microphone
- Game audio
- Discord / Voice chat
- Music
- Browser audio
- Any OBS audio source

Each one becomes its own WAV file, with no compression and no quality loss.

### ⏺️ Automatic Session Capture
The plugin starts and stops automatically with:
- OBS **Recording**
- OBS **Streaming**

No buttons to press. No manual exporting. It just works.

### 🗂️ Clean, Organized Sessions
Every session is saved in its own folder, for example:

```
2026-01-19_20-14-33_RECORDING
 ├─ Mic.wav
 ├─ Game.wav
 ├─ Discord.wav
 ├─ Music.wav
 └─ session.json
```

or

```
2026-01-19_20-14-33_STREAMING
 ├─ Mic.wav
 ├─ Game.wav
 ├─ Discord.wav
 ├─ Music.wav
 └─ session.json
```

### ✂️ Post‑Production Ready
Built‑in processing options include:
- Silence trimming (clean starts and ends)
- Loudness normalization
- Scene change markers
- Time‑aligned metadata
- Custom source aliases for clean file names
